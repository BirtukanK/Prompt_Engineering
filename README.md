Prompt Engineering

This project is about Prompt Engineering in-context learning with GPT-3 and 
other Large Language Models

The first thing to do is understanding 
   1- word embedding
   2- Transfer algorithms
   3- self attention and attention
   4- how text generation models work

After understanding the main and essential concepts then we pass to 
writing the codes that will help us to connect with free APIs to work with 
LLMs.

Here the data we are using are all tracked with remote dvc.
